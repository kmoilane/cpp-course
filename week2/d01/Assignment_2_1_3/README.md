# Optional Assignment 2_1_3

"You are teaching a programming course and you have many exercises that
require peer reviews. The system that is hosting these exercises has broken
and the automatic peer review assignment is not working. Write a program that
lists all the students, and when the program gets run it will automatically
create a peer review list where every student gets to review someone else's
exercise.

Each student will review another person and two students can't review
each others assignments."
