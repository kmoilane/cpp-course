## Exercise 1:

Create a vector<int> with 10 numbers in it. Use std::partition to separate the
even and odd numbers. Print out the vector after partitioning.

## Exerise 2:

Create two std::vector<int> and fill them with random amount of random numbers.
Use std::set_intersection to find common elements between them.

## Exercise 3:

Create a vector with 10 random elements in it. Rotate elements to the right
by 3 positions with std::rotate.

## Exercise 4:

Create a std::list<int> with 10 elements. Use std::adjacent_find to find the
first two adjacent elements that are equal. If no such elements exist, print a
suitable message.

## Exercise 5:

Create a new program that will create a vector of random size, filled with
random numbers between 1 and 100.

## Exercise 6:

Add a function that will output the smallest and largest number in the array.

## Exercise 7:

Add a function that will remove all instances of a value from the vector and
inform if the value was found and removed.
