Group assignment.

You are going to create a tic tac toe game that you can play against
another player or an AI opponent.

You can create the board as a console application and you can have each
player represented by a O or an X.

You can have the opponent choose randomly where it will place its next
move, or you can implement an algorithm to calculate the best move it could 
play.

One such algorithm is called Minimax algorithm that will go trough all the
possible moves and then choose the best one.
