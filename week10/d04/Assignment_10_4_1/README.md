## Exercise 1

Try [libfmt](https://fmt.dev/) by using your system package manager (usually the
package is named fmt or libfmt or libfmt-dev).
While this library is slowly being standardised, it is useful since
the standard adoption progresses quite slowly.

## Exercise 2

Try [backward-cpp](https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp) (cmake instructions
found behind the link),
and check how e.g. assert(0) works before and after you've gotten it to work.
(There should be easily notable difference)

## Exercise 3

Try [nlohmann's json library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)  Use it to read
a json file from your hard drive and print the stored contents.
(You can use e.g. json files from https://github.com/LearnWebCode/json-example)
Then create a json file from your code and save that to your hard drive.

JSON is pretty common format to pass data around as a text.  You are bound to
run into it so this is quite useful (and commonly used) library for the task.
